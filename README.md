# GardenDAO - A Community DAO for a Community Garden

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
GardenDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization meant for starting, funding, and maintaining a community garden.

Community members funded the garden in return for governance tokens which are then used to vote on decesions (What to plant where, who will manage which plants, etc)

The DAO is built on the ethereum blockchain and currently gated by an NFT (free to mint)

Anyone can submit and vote on proposals, at the end of the designated time slot proposals are decided based on token vote count.

Additionally, DAO supports on-chain proposals for minting and transfering tokens from the treasury
